## Example Use

### Input
- **File Format**: PNG (raster image)
- **Example Command**: `python converter.py input.png output.svg`

The ideal input is a line-art style raster image, which can be prepared using image processing tools such as the ControlNet processor with Canny edge detection or line-art conversions.

### Output
- **File Format**: SVG (vector image)
- **Details**: The output SVG file will contain the optimized vector paths suitable for CNC milling and other NC machines.

## Limitations and Known Issues

- Currently supports only PNG format for input. Future updates aim to include more formats.
- Performance may vary with very large images or complex patterns.
- requirements.txt will be prepared in the future.
