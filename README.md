# flats-raster-vector-converter

A Python tool for transforming bitmap images into optimized SVG paths, suitable for various NC machines, including CNC milling and laser cutters. Key features:

* Versatile Application: Ideal for CNC milling G-code generation and adaptable for use with laser cutters and other NC machines.
* A dvanced Image Processing: Implements image skeletonization and other techniques for precise vector conversion.
* Graph Theory Optimization: Utilizes graph theory for efficient path planning.
* TSP Solver Integration: Incorporates OR-Tools' TSP solver for optimal routing.

Designed for professionals and DIY enthusiasts seeking efficient machining and creative applications.

## Example Use

### Input
- **File Format**: PNG (raster image)
- **Example Command**: `python converter.py input.png output.svg`

### Output
- **File Format**: SVG (vector image)
- **Details**: The output SVG file will contain the optimized vector paths suitable for CNC milling and other NC machines.

## Limitations and Known Issues

- Currently supports only PNG format for input. Future updates aim to include more formats.
- Performance may vary with very large images or complex patterns.
- requirements.txt will be prepared in the future.
